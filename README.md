This repository is a mixture of different problems I have solved and want to document it. A majority of chunk would also be Leetcode Solutions.

## Overview

1) **LeetCode:** These are solutions to the problems I have solved on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).
2) **Matrix_Class:** Here I have created my own implementation for a matrix class. More info can be found [here](https://github.com/anirudhtopiwala/OpenSource_Problems/tree/master/Matrix_Class).
3) **Circular_Buffer:** This is my implementation of an overwriting Circular_Buffer. More info can be found [here](https://github.com/anirudhtopiwala/OpenSource_Problems/tree/master/Circular_Buffer).
4) **Spherical Projection for Point Clouds:**  this is also known as Front View projection. Here, a 3D point cloud is converted into a 2D projected image. This is really useful as tried and tested deep learning techniques can now be applied on the image for varied applications like object detection and segmentation. The theory is explained in detail on my medium post [here](https://medium.com/@topiwala.anirudh/spherical-projection-for-point-clouds-56a2fc258e6c) and the code can be found [here](https://github.com/anirudhtopiwala/OpenSource_Problems/tree/master/Spherical_View_Projection).
5) **Intersection Over Union:** C++ implementation of calculating IOU. It can be found [here](https://github.com/anirudhtopiwala/OpenSource_Problems/tree/master/IOU).
6) **Point in Polygon:** C++ implementation of winding number algorithm to check if a point lies Inside, On or Outside a given polygon. It can be found [here](https://github.com/anirudhtopiwala/OpenSource_Problems/tree/master/Point_In_Polygon).
7) **Blur the Background** Python implementation of a live script to blur the background using two different approaches. It can be found [here](https://github.com/anirudhtopiwala/OpenSource_Problems/tree/master/Background_Blur).
